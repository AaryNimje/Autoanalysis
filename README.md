## Autolysis: Automated Data Analysis and Storytelling with LLMs ##
Autolysis is a Python-based project that automates the analysis, visualization, and narration of insights from datasets using large language models (LLMs). This project showcases the power of GPT-4o-Mini for generating meaningful insights and storytelling from structured data.

## Overview ##
This repository contains:

autolysis.py: A self-contained Python script that performs automated analysis and storytelling on a given CSV file.
Results: Analysis outputs for three sample datasets (goodreads.csv, happiness.csv, media.csv) in dedicated directories:
Goodreads Analysis
Happiness Report Analysis
Media Ratings Analysis
Each directory contains:

A README.md with the narrative generated by the LLM.
Supporting visualizations as PNG files.

## Features ##
Data Analysis: Generic and dataset-specific statistical exploration, including summary statistics, missing value detection, outlier identification, correlation analysis, and clustering.
Visualization: Automatically generates charts to support data narratives.
Storytelling: Uses GPT-4o-Mini to narrate a comprehensive story based on the data and insights derived.
Dynamic Prompting: Efficient use of LLM tokens with dynamic prompts and function calls.
Portable and Lightweight: All functionality embedded in a single Python script for ease of execution.
## Installation and Usage ##
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required libraries (automatically installed with uv): pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, openai, etc.

Setting Up
1) Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/autolysis.git
cd autolysis

2) Install uv (if not already installed):
pip install uvicorn

3) Set up your AI Proxy Token:
export AIPROXY_TOKEN='your-token-here'

4) Running the Script
Run the script with any valid CSV dataset:
uv run autolysis.py dataset.csv
Outputs will be generated in the current directory:

README.md: Narrative analysis.
*.png: Supporting visualizations.
Example Datasets
Try the script on the included datasets:
uv run autolysis.py goodreads.csv
uv run autolysis.py happiness.csv
uv run autolysis.py media.csv
Results for each dataset can be found in their respective directories.

## Example Outputs ##
Goodreads Dataset
The Goodreads dataset contains metadata for 10,000 books. Analysis highlights include:

Popular genres based on average ratings.
Clustering of books by ratings and page count.
Insights into correlations between genre and popularity.

Happiness Dataset
The Happiness dataset is derived from the World Happiness Report. Key findings:

Correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores.
Outlier analysis revealing countries with unexpected happiness scores.
Clustering based on socio-economic factors.

Media Dataset
The Media dataset provides ratings for movies, TV series, and books. Insights include:

Distribution of ratings across different media types.
Correlation between runtime and ratings for TV series.
Identification of standout titles in each category.
## Future Improvements ##
Support for additional visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, Altair).
Enhanced anomaly detection with unsupervised learning models.
Expanded narrative generation with richer context and visual integration.
